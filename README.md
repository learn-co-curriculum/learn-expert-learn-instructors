# Interface with Section Leads

## Who are the Section Leads?

![Section Leads](http://i.giphy.com/QHE5gWI0QjqF2.gif "Section Leads")

There are three teams that help students to succeed. The Technical Coaches who staff the "Ask a Question" feature, providing real time support to students.

Portfolio Support Coaches schedule 1:1 with students via the [Portfolio Support](https://theflatironschool.typeform.com/to/UUhrc7) link to help them debug their portfolio projects when they get stuck and can't find a solution.

The Section Leads are full time employees with two main responsibilities:

1. Owning a section of the curriculum. Doing what it takes to help students to learn and complete their section as quickly as possible.

2. Ensuring the quality of our graduates by conducting live assessments to determine how well they have met the functional requirements of the project, can explain the key principles we've been teaching and can live code working functionality.

## How would a Technical Coach interact with a Section Lead?

There are three primary ways Technical Coaches interact with the Section Leads:
 - If you raise an issue on a lab, you'll now know who to @ mention on the lab (if no one is listed as the owner of that section of curriculum, you can just @ mention ruth [@ruth]).
 - If you see a student that consistently doesn't understand a  concept (they keep asking questions on the same subject and they don't seem to be getting it), you can DM the section lead in charge of that section in slack to let them know that they may have a struggling student.
 - If a student asks for help with an assessment, you should first give them the link for [Portfolio Support](https://theflatironschool.typeform.com/to/UUhrc7). If the student is persistent that they speak to a section lead, you should direct them to the section lead who is responsible for the section containing the assessment (not the section lead who administers that assessment, so if it's a Sinatra issue it goes to Cernan, not Luisa)
